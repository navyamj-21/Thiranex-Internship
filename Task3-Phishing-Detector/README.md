# Task 3 — Phishing Email Detection Model

## What it does
- Trains a machine learning model to classify emails as Phishing or Safe
- Uses TF-IDF to convert email text into numerical features
- Trained with Logistic Regression on a combined dataset (Enron, CEAS, Nazario, SpamAssassin, etc.)
- Achieves 98% accuracy
- Displays confusion matrix and classification report
- Tests prediction on a custom sample email

## Dataset
Phishing Email Dataset (Kaggle) — combines Enron, Ling, CEAS, Nazario, 
Nigerian Fraud, and SpamAssassin datasets. ~82,000 labeled emails.

## How to run
1. pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Download dataset from Kaggle and place phishing_email.csv in the same folder
3. python phishing_model.py

## Results
- Accuracy: 98.04%
- Precision/Recall: 0.98 for both classes

## Concepts used
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)
- Supervised machine learning classification
- Train/test split methodology
- Model evaluation (confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)
